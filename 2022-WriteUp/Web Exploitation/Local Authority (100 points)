Problem Statement: Can you get the flag? http://saturn.picoctf.net:54554/login.php

My Process / Solution

1) Inspecting the elements of the page don't reveal anything of importance. Attempting admin/admin gets a default login denied page.
2) Inspecting the elements of the login denied page shows a secure.js file, which has the authentication details. Using these on the original page yields the flag.
