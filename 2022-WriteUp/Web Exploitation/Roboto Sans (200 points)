Problem Statement: The flag is somewhere on this web application not necessarily on the website. Find it. saturn.picoctf.net:65352

My Process / Solution

1) I could find nothing in the client side code. Taking a step back the title refers to a font hint or a robot file, perhaps. I found a /robot.txt file on the website, which displayed:

"User-agent *
Disallow: /cgi-bin/
Think you have seen your flag or want to keep looking.

ZmxhZzEudHh0;anMvbXlmaW
anMvbXlmaWxlLnR4dA==
svssshjweuiwl;oiho.bsvdaslejg
Disallow: /wp-admin/"

Which is on the nose way of saying this is the flag.

2) The == indicates base 64 encoding. Putting it through an online decoder gives... slightly less gibberish. Fiddling with the code by eliminating the line breaks does nothing, but dropping the third line indicates there is a potential file path. Only decoding the second line gives it: js/myfile.txt
3) http://saturn.picoctf.net:65352/js/myfile.txt gives the flag.

Flag: picoCTF{Who_D03sN7_L1k5_90B0T5_718c9043}
