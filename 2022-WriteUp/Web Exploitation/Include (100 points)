Name: Includes
Points: 100
Category: Web Exploitation
Problem Statement: Many programming languages and other computer files have a directive, often called include (sometimes copy or import), that causes the contents of a second file to be inserted into the original file. These included files are called copybooks or header files. They are often used to define the physical layout of program data, pieces of procedural code and/or forward declarations while promoting encapsulation and the reuse of code. http://saturn.picoctf.net:54634/
