Name: Forbidden Paths

Problem Statement: We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag? http://saturn.picoctf.net:53864/

My Process / Solution

1) The website seems to display any file's content given its path. Trying /usr/share/nginx/html/flag.txt to validate the protection shows authorisation denied, which we expected.
2) Trying ../../../../flag.txt works. The ../ denotes the directory as a whole, but as a relative path.
