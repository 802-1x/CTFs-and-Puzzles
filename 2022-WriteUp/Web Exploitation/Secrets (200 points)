Problem Statement: We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag? saturn.picoctf.net:61481/

My Process / Solution

1) Inspecting the elements of the page shows two sub-folders. The second is permission denied, but the first seems promising given the match to this challenge's title. Going to the /secret sub folder of the site gives another index.html page.
2) The amusing gif hint indicates that the first step should be repeated. We now have /hidden as well.
3) We're now on a login page: http://saturn.picoctf.net:61481/secret/hidden/
   I tried an immediate SQL injection attempt, but a quick look at the code of the button shows it is pointless. Repeating step 1 shows another recusive folder.
4) We're now on a page with a challenge: http://saturn.picoctf.net:61481/secret/hidden/superhidden/
   "Finally. You found me. But can you see me"
   Inspecting the HTML immediately reveals the flag.
