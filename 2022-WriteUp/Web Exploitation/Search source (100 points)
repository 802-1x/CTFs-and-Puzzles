Problem Statement: The developer of this website mistakenly left an important artifact in the website source, can you find it? saturn.picoctf.net:58133/

My Process / Solution

1) The problem statement indicates we're still digging through client side content. This was an easy find and rather cute: "The flag is not here but keep digging :)" The flag though is in style.css
