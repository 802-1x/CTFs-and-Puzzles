Problem Statement: Can you beat the filters? Log in as admin http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9683/ http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9683/filter.php

My Process / Solution

ROUND 1
1) Inspecting the page reveals two links. One contains a web form with two inputs (username and password). The file contains the filter for this round. In this case an or.
2) Trying a random username/password combination reveals the underlying SQL query in the background. Using admin'-- solves the first round. 

ROUND 2
1) Inspecting the filter.php file again shows: Round2: or and like = --
2) Trying another style of comment (#) doesn't work, but /* does. So using a username of admin'/* gets us through the second round.

ROUND 3
1) Inspecting the filter.php file shows: Round3: or and = like > < --
2) This was a bit of a fail. I refreshed the website, which automatically tried using my last attempt (admin'/*) and it worked. Onto the next round I guess.

ROUND 4
1) Inspecting the filter.php file shows: Round4: or and = like > < -- admin
2) We cannot use admin, despite that being the username. We just need to be creative and cocatenate through: a'||'dmin'/*

ROUND 5
1) Inspecting the filter.php file shows: Round5: or and = like > < -- union admin
2) Another fail. Refreshing the webpage automatically resolved the round just like the third round.

Inspecting the filter.php file now reveals the flag.
