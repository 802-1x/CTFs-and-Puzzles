Problem Statement: Can you find the robots? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/56830/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:56830

My Process / Solution

1) A quick inspection of the client-side code shows nothing of interest. I tried going to /robots.txt, which provided directions to /1bb4c.html. There was the flag. Bit dissappointed as I'd prefer to see a use of DirBuster or similar.

Flag: picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_1bb4c}
