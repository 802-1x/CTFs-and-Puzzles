Problem Statement: The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44573/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44573

My Process / Solution

1) A quick inspection of the client-side code shows nothing of interest.
2) Given the mention of a user in the problem statement, I tried an authentication attempt using Joe. Failed with a comment about a password being required.
3) SQL injection attempted for username Joe worked on first attempt by just using a comment (example: Joe'). Still no flag, but I am logged in.
4) Another inspection of the client-side code using Application tab element inspection shows that the site stores thre cookies upon login: a username string, a password string, and an admin boolean. Changing the admin cookie from False to True allowed me to manipulate the server into thinking that we are an administrator. Refreshing the page reveals the flag.
